Whenever a subject of hers is defeated, she will shake her fist at Cuphead and/or Mugman in aggression.

      "personality": "Captain Brineybeard seems to taunt his opponents before fighting them; this is hinted at the base part of the level as he laughs at both Cuphead and Mugman before they even begin to battle him. His speech is like a stereotypical pirate, with examples being not even conjugating the verb 'be' and using the accusative 'me' instead of the proper genitive 'my' in the first person and 'yer' in the second person. ('Your skills are like my buried treasure! Just a myth,' from his death screen, for example, becomes 'Yer skills be like me buried treasure! Just a myth!'')",

      "description": "Werner Werman is a boss unlocked after defeating Sally Stageplay or completing either of the Run n' Gun levels Perilous Piers and Rugged Ridge.",
      "appearance": "Werner is a long-snouted brown rat who operates a dented red tin soup can that bears 4 gold stars perched on a wooden cart that he uses as a battle tank. (Although during his second phase, it crumbes, leaving behind only the cart that his tank was perched on and exposing him to his opponents.) He wears white gloves, blue shoes, and light brown pants (with a tan stripe running down each side of the pants) held up by a single suspender strap. His most notable feature is his metal Pickelhaube helmet strapped to his head, giving him a slight resemblance in his design to a Prussian soldier. He also smokes a cigar. In The Cuphead Show!, his appearance remains the same, only Werner has a pink fleshy tail with a bandage wrap tied around it and either a fake German accent or can also speak with an American accent.",
      "personality": "Werner Werman is cantankerous and a military master in his own mind. Werner Werman acts like a stereotypical German soldier from World War I, speaking in a thick and exaggerated German accent (warping his TH sequences into Z's and his W's to V's) and making a salute whenever he charges forward to attack with his tank. He appears to be interested in the late 1700- early 1900 military as he is wearing a Prussian soldier helmet (Pickelhaube) and owns a Colonial British soldier figurine.",

She appears to be trying to seduce Cuphead and Mugman, as seen in her intro where she makes a sweet 'yoo-hoo!' sound while fluttering her eyelashes and making a pose. She may be trying to tempt them in closer and catch them off-guard, so she can attack them. A classic move for mythological sirens. Her first phase death message only helps support this. She becomes more cruel after she is forcefully transformed into a gorgon-mermaid, due to electric eels biting her waist and shocking her.",

While the color of his face matches that of his fur, the bare skin on his hands and feet are a much lighter grey; at the end of each of his fingers and toes are short, pointed claws. He is often illustrated carrying a pitchfork in his hand and/or tapping the big toe on one of his feet.",
      "personality": "As the series' own interpretation of Satan, the Devil is an appropriately sinister character, being feared for his adept use of trickery and deception. By taking advantage of his victims' latent greed, the Devil is shown to use gambling at his casino as a method by which to encourage his victims into making increasingly reckless, Faustian bets, eventually culminating in the forfeiture of their soul to him upon their loss. While only the ruler of the underground depths known as Inkwell Hell, the threat of his influence can nevertheless be felt all across Inkwell Isle. Even Cuphead and Mugman are said to have received 'many warnings' by the Elder Kettle to steer clear of the casino entirely. He is also very evil, as when Cuphead loses and the devil wins the bet, he is always willing to take their souls with no problem at all. The Devil has no problem of using something to destroy a person during a battle, showing him as not just evil, but unusually very murderous too. Despite these traits, whenever he is talking to his closest minions, such as King Dice, he is usually happy and normal to talk and chat with him.",
